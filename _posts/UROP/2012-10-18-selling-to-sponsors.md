# 6.UAR: Selling to Sponsors

(kind of sketchy notes. distracted/hosed.)

## ARPA
- workshops
- stimulating innovation from adjacent fields
- Amit Narayan (?): OpenADR

## Fueling the Endless Frontier (NSF)
- innovation spectrum
	- academia, SBR, valley of death, investors, industry
	- accelerate innovation to get over the valley of death
- try to move things more toward the SBR route
### [Innovation Corps](http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/)
- deal with bridging the valley of death
- how do you translate high potential research into implementation?
- $6B of research funding to keep research moving over this valley
- team composition:
	- entrepreneurial lead: student/post-doc looking for the next gig
	- PI: researcher who's settled, but knows the tech
	- I-Corps mentor: domain-relevant volunteer business guide
- rolling cycle for submitting proposals

## Ray Stata
- where does innovation happen?
- technology/business matrix
- latent needs
	- stimulates business
	- probably new tech
- optmization
	- proven existing needs
	- need significant technological change
- etc, etc

### Characteristics of an Entrepreneur
- high degree of self-confidence
- storytelling
- persuasiveness
- passion and energy
- courage
- leadership

## Panel
### protecting startups
- IP/patents
- speed of execution: LIGHTING SPEED WOO
### predict lucrative emerging technologies
- interdisciplinary actions: not really predictable
- if you really want to look for change in the house, look at the areas where the cushions come together
- go look at the strategic plan of the university's department.
- professors are entrepreneurs in a way: investing in the university's future
### moving on from startup failures
- nbd, guys
- failing fast is way better than doing a zombie march
- failure as an incredible form of feedback
- serial entrepreneurs succeed eventually
- pivot pivot pivot
	- ex: icorps application (how a substance permeates a membrane) pivoted into cosmetics
	- pivot from super technical to unknown but lucrative market

### finding problems for solutions
- most of research focus on problems, given solutions. how do you deal with dead-end papers?
- TALK TO PEOPLE. Get out of your silo, and talk to various markets.
- VC and other investors look for a diverse team for exactly this reason.
- nature of the team to learn from experience, to be able to handle pivot points

### long term planning?
- meh. need to be able to pivot quickly.
- maintain a plan, but be able to pivot.
