# Crowd Code Review

## Problem
- 2M loc for 6.005
- want feedback fast
	- also detailed, rich, and diverse
- want to move it out to MITx, which worsens the problem
- pyramid: staff, students
	- draw on the large student group to do most of the code reviewing

### Context
- edX parasitic on a general code reviewing system
	- duo lingo
- I review your code, you review mine

### Incentives for alums
- altruism
- recruiting
	- mostly older alums
	- successful in 6.172
- reputation
	- mostly relevant for edX

### Why alums?
- provide value from industry that the students can not
- what distinguishes alum work from student work?
	- it's nice to get some alumni-student interaction

## System
- get a large pile of similar submissions, split into chunks
	- method level
	- class level
		- more useful comments at this level
- select chunks to review
	- how much did the student actually write in this piece?
- assign at least 2 reviewers on each of these chunks
	- have a "view all code" button

### Review types
- bugs?
- clarity
- simplicity
- style

## System behavior
- establishing norms
	- sprinkle comments in initially
