# Lecture 17: Jean Renoir and Poetic Realism

## Death of the studio system
- 1970s: filmmakers arble to stretch out over old bounds of Hollywoo movies, examining more explicit themes, with machinery of Hollywood cinema still in place
- if you go to the movies, you'd better see something awesome and spectacular
	- no longer go to see domestic dramas, etc.

## French film
- critics argue that French films are even more delightful than Hollywood

### Parallel history in Silent Era
- Melière pioneered techniques
	- expressive side of French film
	- olap dissolve: overlapping dissolve technique
- Max Linder
	- Chaplin-esque director in France
- Ferdinand Zecca
	- Mack Sennet equivalent
	- cop chase films
- Abel Gance
	- ambitious silent director, created cinemascape
	- widescreen panoramic films
	- major orchestration
	- ex: _Napoleon_

### film theory
- first people to articulate formal theories of film
- Louis Deluc started the first cinema clubs for discussion (Cinéclubs)
	- developed a formal language to describe the unique and special features of movies

## Jean Renoir (1894-1979)
- stands out as the primary example of French film
- André Bézin:
> No one has grasped the true nature of the screen better than Renoir; no one has more successfully rid it of. the equivocal analogies with painting and the theater. Plastically the screen is most often made to conform to the limits of a canvas, and dramatically it is modeled after the stage. With these two traditional references in mind, directors tend to conceive their images as boxed within a rectangle as do the painter and the stage director. Renoir, on the other hand, understands that the screen is not a simple rectangle but rather the homothetic surface of the viewfinder of his camera. It is the very opposite of a frame. The screen is a mask whose function is no less to hide reality,than it is to reveal it. The significance of what the camera discloses is relative to what it leaves hidden. But this invisible, witness is inevitably made to wear blinders; its ideal ubiquity is restrained by framing, just as tyranny is often restrained by assassination.
	- fluid character of the camera: actually explored what you can do with film

> Technically this conception of the screen assumes what I shall call lateral depth of field and the almost total disappearance of montage. Since what we are shown is only significant in terms of what is hidden from us and since therefore the value of what we see is continually threatened, the mise-en-scene cannot limit itself to what is presented on the screen. The rest of the scene, while effectively hidden, should not cease to exist. The action is not bounded by the screen, but merely passes through it. And a person who enters the camera's field of vision is coming from other areas of the action, and not fro m some limbo, some imaginary "backstage." Likewise, the camera should be able to spin suddenly without picking up any holes or dead spots in the action.
- "passing through": incredible insight into Renoir's work

### Childhoood
- father was Pierre Renoir, the impressionist painter
- shows up as a little redheaded boy in Renoir's paintings
- came from a very film-centered family
- was a prisoner of war in World War I
- served in the cavalry, infantry, and was a pilot
- returned from the war with artistic ambitions

### Visual Style on moral vision
- broader conception as generous, understanding, sympathetic, yet judgmental view
- minute technical practices of Renoir allow the complexity of judgment involved to come through
	- camera has a semi-character: you can feel its curiosity
	- making a series of constant adjustments to the world around it
- begin to get a sense of how the world is filled with a surplus of significance
- mark of Renoir/the camera's humility: there is too much in the world to take in at once
- recognition of the overwhelming complexity of actuality
- embed his characters in an interesting locale: the setting becomes an aspect/expression of character

### Filmography
- 1926: _Nana_ (Zola novel)
	- mark of his ambition: the fact that he would dare to make a movie based on a literary treasure is a mark of his belief in the film medium
	- same hope for film as DW Griffith had
- 1928: _The Little Match Girl_
	- gruesome Hans Christian Anderson story: uncharacteristic for film
- 1931: _La Chienne_
	- story of a nasty prostitute: the bitch of the title
	- shows characteristic features of Renoir's work:
		- interest in social justice
		- political, bordering on propaganda
	- Michel Symon character became famous for embodying proletarian rage
- 1932: _Boudu Saved From Drowning_
	- examines the middle class in France
	- about a bourgeoise bookseller who saves a tramp from drowning
	- reforms Boudu into a civilized person; he'll have none of it
	- Boudu represents the wild crazy force of nature: untamable, but neither good nor bad
- 1934: _Madame Bovary_ (Flaubert novel)
- 1935: _Toni_
	- origin of Italian neo-realism
	- examines Italian quarry workers
- 1937: _Grand Illusion_
	- implicitly covers the fate of France
- 1939: _Rules of the Game_
	- more complex and subtle film
	- subject is explicitly the fate of France
	- marquis who brings people up to his chateau for various rich people's amusements
	- hunting, dancing, etc: each one of these rituals are curdled in some way
	- Chekov's "Cherry Orchard"
	- decline of aristocracy, rise of the middle class, the submerging of values that used to organize the aristocracy
	- morally ambiguous attitude toward this decline
		- aware of the complacency and injustice
		- also recognizes the loss of culture and melancholy for what's lost
- 1950: _The River_
	- film set in India
	- focuses on lower-class characters
	- centrality of the Ganges in the life of the people who live near it

## Poetic Realism
### Forerunner: Jean Vigo (1905-34)
- _Zero for Conduct_
	- anticipates the fascination with children
	- draws on boarding school experiences to depict a repressive and bureaucratised educational establishment in which surreal acts of rebellion occur
	- many Italian realism films are entirely about children
- Adalanta
	- stars Michel Symone
	- disturbing film about a guy who runs a canal barge
	- road movie set on the river

### Key features
- Mise-en-scène style
	- very long cuts
	- take time to establish space and environment, which become an important part of the story
	- makes you aware of the fact that there's much in the world the camera doesn't see
	- really emphasizes that the characters are interacting in a world where there's a ton going on
	- there's always a middle ground, foreground, and background
		- maintain multiple foci of attention to fully understand the film
- in-camera editing
	- the camera watching the action will discover a new field of interest, and will change its focal length
	- committed to depth of field
	- watch the camera as it changes its interest: sound will often pull the camera around like it was a person
	- cuts and focus were done by the cameraman, not at the editing table
	- done so subtly that you don't notice at first
- on-location filming
	- committed to using true light and sound
	- range of tones is greater
- diagetic sound
	- if committed to making films that reflect reality, you'd want to reject artifice as much as possible.
	- extra-diagetic adds fake
- moving, fluid camera

## Clips
### The ending of _Boudu_
- especially important because of a comment by Bézin
- there's an astonishing moment in which the camera makes a very slow complete swerve
- doesn't forward the story in any way: not a narrative move
- boat enters the squence, diagetic music
- camera spins entirely around the couple
- Bazin
	- accidentally falls into the water
	- important that it's an accident: he's just nature. he goes off of the instinct of the moment.
	- is it despair? is it escape? it's only escape after he drops in the water.
	- Renoir, like his character, becomes the act, not the fact
	- the driving force isn't any of his intentions, but the pleasure of the character
	- when he comes on the bank, there's a 180degree pan that shows you the countryside he sees before him
	- the grass and the dust and its relationship to the freedom of the tramp
		- deeply realistic, but has a deep poetic significance

### Dinner in prison: _Grand Illusion_
- character enters scene, camera follows character and pans over the entire room
- constant activity: in the room, as you pan over, and even out through the window
- would have to watch that scene two or three times to get a real handle on every character
- vulgar joke guy (actor/clown), working class fellow who prefers wrestling matches and bars, aristocrat
