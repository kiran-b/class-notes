# Akira Kurosawa (1910-1998) and _Rashomon_

## The "moment" of Rashomon
- film as an international medium
	- only American cinema was really shown internationally
	- _Rashomon_ changed how movies were organized/distributed
- modernist cinema
	- 1950s changed to new form of cinema
	- Demanded more from the audience
	- changed from profoundly realistic to more fantastical
	- Name refers to change of books and art (Picasso in the 1910s, for ex)
- Ingmar Bergman (1918-2007)
	- _Wild Strawberries_
		- non-linear narrative, with other pieces woven in
		- like a Virginia Woolf or Faulkner novel
	- not seen in the US until Scorsese or Robert Altman (when cinema ceased to be consensus narrative)
- Satyajit Ray (1921-1992)
	- Apu trilogy
	- movies unlike any ever seen in India
- Federico Fellini (1921-1993)
	- _8 1/2_ about the failure to make a movie
	- _La Dolce Vita_
- Faulkner-style narrative picked up by cinema

## Japanese Cinema: a note
- theatrical traditions
	- exaggerated (almost comical) gestures taken from Kabuki and No (?) theater
	- very traditional to have a character called a "benshi," a narrative character
		- do live voiceovers for silent films
		- a crude marriage of live cinema and theater?
- Kenji Mizoguchi (1898-1956)
- Yasujiro Ozu (1903-1963)

## Kurosawa
- studied western cinema greatly, much influenced by John Ford
	- _Rashomon_ gate at the ending similar to framing shots in _The Searchers_
	- mutual sharing of influence
- Assistant director in 1926, directed 10 films in 1940s
- did both period films and films set in contemporary Japan
	- interesting that _Rashomon_ is set in such a distant time, since it ended up with very cartoonish characters
- the Kurosawa-gumi
	- Kurosawa "group": team of actors, cinematographers, composers, scriptwriters, etc.
	- like a theatrical repertory for cinema
- famous films
	- _Rashomon_ (1950)
	- _Ikiru_ (1952): "to live"
	- _Seven Samurai_ (1954)
		- (arguably) his most significant films
		- remade as _The Magnificent Seven_ and _Magnificent Seven Returns_, westerns by Hollywood
- as he gained influence, he began to pick up and remake western texts
	- _Throne of Blood_ (1957)
		- well-known remake of Macbeth
		- also _Ran_, later
	- took on Gorky's play, also adapted by Renoir
	- sense of self: knew that he could take on Shakespeare at this point

## _La Dolce Vita_ scene
- Jesus hovering over Rome, then jump cut into a very odd and risqu√© nightclub
- principle of delayed disclosure, much like a Faulkner novel
- only after the film is nearly over do you understand the juxtaposition between modern technology and Jesus
- critique of the decadence of modern life, but initially shocking and disconcerting

## _Rashomon_
- title is a reference to a gate or entrance to Kyoto
	- gilded gate falling apart
	- go under the gate to protect themselves from the pouring rain
- historical setting explains stylistic choices (No/Kabuki theater)
- subject matter is very ancient and legend-like
	- semi-offensive to modern, post-feminist sensibilities
	- analogy to Rape of Europa

### Background
- very low-budget, unprestigious film
- film was a sensation: won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival
- had a strong impact on technical film
- success created Japanese film as an international movement
- created the idea that film was not necessarily an outgrowth of a country's culture, but part of an international movement
- Kurosawa was the most western of Japanese directors

### Subjectivity of reality/Unreliable narrator
- _Rashomon_ effect is a law term: unreliability of witnesses
- everyone in the film is flawed in some way
- commonplace of modernist literature
- Miko: the medium
	- very stylized Kabuki-like performance of the dead samurai's story
	- how much impact does this "testimony" get?
	- reinforces how stylized the film is
- narrative of the woodcutter put into doubt, too
- epistemological subject: sources of truth, grounds of knowing
	- philosophical narrative of the unreliability of truth

### drama of the telling
- as she tells the story, we drop into a realistic enactment of the narrative
- in her performance, there's a moment where she reenacts the suicide
	- doubling the suicide, in realistic and Kabuki form
	- everything can be represented in different ways
- the story is always doubled: creates two separate stories
	- story of the rape
	- story of the making of the story
- keep coming back to the gate: reminded of the construction of the story
	- made by human narrators who have motives to distort the events
	- three men act as a chorus
- common in novels by Proust, Woolf, Faulkner, Conrad
- opens up films in a profound way
- prepares the ground for the profound self-consciousness found in the nouvelle vague

### Visual Style
- dynamic, eclectic: "a real surrealism"
- realistic sense of the visual imagery, combined with the unrealistic subject matter and the subjectivity of the narrators
- can be fooled by what we see because of the realistic nature of the imagery
- fuzzy distinction between the real and the surreal
- camera's immobile as the characters behave in very stylized ways
- violates principles of cinema
	- shoots directly into the sun
	- 180 degree rule: if you see a character walking in one direction, always shoot him in that direction.
	- violates that rule: super disorienting
- very cinematic, almost silent
	- remarkable how little dialogue there is in the film
- "real surrealism": constant tension b/w the granularity of the image and the disorienting camera
	- not in a normal/real space
- chiaroscuro dappled effect of light/dark is crucial
	- Robert Altman loved this shit
	- spoke often of the influence of this film on his work
- woman's fingers desperately gripping rapist's arm: very real sequence in the super surreal surroundings
	- we're seeing an element of real in this web of untruth
- agility and incredible beauty of the camera
	- immerse you in an unrecognizably sinister world

### ending: delete it?
	- tacked on hopeful, happy ending?
	- rain stops, child crying, woodcutter takes it
	- until now, the music has been western, but becomes traditional japanese music
	- priest: "you've restored my faith in humanity"
