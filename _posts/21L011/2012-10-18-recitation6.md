# Recitation 6: Hitchcock

## _Shadow of a Doubt_

### American family
- lots of full family scenes
	- opening
	- dinner scenes
	- finale
- Charlie's commentary on the family
	- "this family's fallen to pieces. We just go along and nothing happens"
	- "I'm waiting for a miracle"
	- parallel to Charlie's nihilistic speech later on
	- almost the whole family in the same room
- regifting sinister gifts
- parallels between Charlie and Charlie
	- I want something interesting, but I could fall to that
- counterpoint to the ideal of the 50s family
- father's an incredibly weak male character compared to Uncle Charlie

### Santa Rosa
- first meet Uncle Charlie in an urban area
	- final shot is a big pile of trash in a questionable neighborhood
- contrasted with this beautiful and perfect suburban town
	- the policeman helps people cross the street
	- idea that danger comes from the outside in this idyllic suburb
- real danger really from inside the family
	- the complacency of the family?
	-let this evil come in, but don't act upon it.

## _Rear Window_

### Class tensions in couples
- three categories of couples: working class, high class, mixed
- disconnect between Jeff and Lisa: different backgrounds
- "dog" couple (working class)
	- never quarrel
	- work past their difficulties together
- murder couple (working class)
- composer
- lonely lady
	- aspiring to be high class
	- great contrast to Jeff's go-getter attitude
- turning point: Lisa climbing the ladder, Jeff's reaction

### Disconnect in society
- echoes _Shadow of a Doubt_
- speech about the dog: disconnected neighbors
- mismatch between the young couple
- lonelyheart and the composer: connected through music. importance of that sort of substance.
- Jeff and Lisa on different levels?

- Lisa introduced in shadow
	- that's how you introduce a monster!
