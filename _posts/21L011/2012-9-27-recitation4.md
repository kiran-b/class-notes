# Recitation 4: German Expressionism

## Jump cuts
- as opposed to the normal invisible cuts
- calls attention to the fact that the audience is in a room, watching a movie
- cut out about a second of film, tops
- only seeing cuts, not jump cuts, in a film

## Last Laugh
- moving camera, subjective camera
- working class tragedy
	- pride and respect of the uniform and steady job
	- don't have the means

### opening hotel scene
- intensifies certain moments in the film
- opening shot, camera going down in the hotel
- bars remind you of a cage, confinement
- constantly return to the revolving door
	- like a roulette wheel: odds stacked against you
	- constantly spinning: very mechanical feel
- high camera angles
	- looking down on the actors and workers
	- like watching ants
- the trunk keeps coming back to him
	- dream of the trunk
- takes the job and his looks and carriage very seriously
- takes a lot of pride in his work

### Firing scene
- boss has turned his back on him, and has gone back to work
	- pulls out glasses and starts reading
- camera pulls in: world's closing in around him
- subjective camera: when he looks at the letter again
	- not a normal point of view shot: he's only focused on the letter "the"
- boss washes his hands after he fires him
- being stripped of his uniform: means everything to him
- behaves completely helpless in the entire scene
	- one try with the trunk, then completely passive
	- passive males are seen repeatedly in German Weimar-era films
	- damaged men from WWI, not the macho men in American cinema at this time
	- damaged men pop up after WWII

### Drunk
- subjective camera: world collapsing on him
	- concise visual way to represent how he's feeling
- camera pulls back very quickly from the drunk trumpeters
- drunk scene of the camera spinning around the actor
	- in credibly innovative scene of the double vision, blurring, spinning, overlay of scenes
- fade into dreamland
	- dealing with the trunk in the apartment complex
	- ties his work and real life together: how successful he is at work determines how much respect he gets at home
	- dining room of home through revolving doors of hotel
- the double door as a step down from the revolving door
- quick pull into a closeup emphasizes the shock about his demotion

## Point of View vs. Objective
- Lady in the Lake, film noir
	- point of view: camera literally follows actor's head as he walks around
- direct address is really odd

## Damaged Men
- Krakauer
- film is a reflection of the culture in which they were produced.
- Films made in the Weimar era show the vulnerability of post-war Germany
- everyone is a witness, but nobody does anything (Hutter and the other males in the town)
- silent resignation foreshadows the passivity of many people under Hitler
