## Themes

### Show Business
- putting on a show
	- musicals are self-conscious. a significant number of musicals involve putting on musicals.
	- backstage story
	- among the central elements of a great number of films
	- _Singing in the Rain_ explores this subject really well
	- embedded in this subject is this self-reflexiveness
	- plays games with the difference between the outer appearance and inner reality
	- as you see sets in the movie, you realize that this movie is itself a product of industrial magic
- community
	- putting on a show requires a community to work together
	- often the blocking agent is precisely the nasty star/headliner who is so contemptuous, hierarchic, etc.
		- introduces elements of hostility and disfunction that threaten the community
		- only functions well when the blocking agent is removed
		- deeply political subject: implicit class argument

### Class Struggle
- comes out of the class struggle between the stars and the understudy
- member of the privileged class (star) vs. talented working class

### High Culture
- high culture vs. popular culture
- grand openings for blockbusters, often in several cities at once
- opening of _Singing in the Rain_ is the grand opening of a film
	- headliner gives us this grandiose biography
	- "educated in the finest conservatories, etc." as the screen shows you humbler beginnings
	- he learned his trade in the most raucous form of populous culture: the burlesque stage
- shows this struggle between an archaic high culture and a slimy vernacular democractic exuberant popular culture
	- sets itself agains this higher older cultural forms (opera, theater, etc)
	- contains an implicit democractic message
	- self-referential

### Constraints vs. Spontaneity
- convention, restraint vs. spontaneity, energy, "the natural"
- see this struggle happen over and over again
- musicals are on the side of spontaneity
- song and dance itself is a refinement of the impulse toward motion and energy

## History
- 1929: _Broadway Melody_
	- first fully synchronous film
	- first backstage film
	- two sisters on Broadway who work their way up to be stars

### musical revue
- sort of recreation of _Ziegfried Follies_
- threadbare plot with lots of music
- multi-act popular theatrical entertainment that combines music, dance and sketches
- super popular form

### operetta
- in combination with European directors; show European sensibilities
- maintains linkages with the old high culture opera, and had a sort of high culture bias uncharacteristic of other Hollywood movies
- _Love Me Tonight_ (Rouben Mamoulian, 1932)
	- male star played by Maurice Chevalier, a French star who could barely speak English
	- works as a tailor in Paris, who mostly deals with aristocrat customers
	- poses as a nobleman and falls in love with a princess

### Pass-along song
- "Isn't It Romantic," _Love Me Tonight_
	- enacts the travels the protagonist will endure later
	- dramatizes the power of music to cross social barriers
		- tailor, taxi driver, composer, soldiers, gypsies, Princess Jeanette

### Busby Berkeley & Warner Brothers
- legendary choreography
- the inventor/creator of the music video
- something about the cinematic space to facilitate connections between song and visuals
	- explores the unique properties of the motion picture camera
	- people went to movies to watch the Busby Berkeley production numbers
-  “kaleidoscopic patterns of female flesh, dissolving into artichokes, exploding stars, snowflakes, and leaves of water lilies.”
- characters and plots are superficial, but the music and production is intense
- crazy camera work
	-	rhythmic camera and cutting
	- monorail for the camera
	- cut holes in studio ceilings and floors to film from above and below
- weakness
	- objectified women intensely
	- buttocks, bosoms, long legs, etc.
	- human element dissapeared
- _42nd_ Street (1933)
	- most characteristic Busby piece
	- kept outdoing himself
	- human figures become unrecognizable: dissolve into abstract patterns
