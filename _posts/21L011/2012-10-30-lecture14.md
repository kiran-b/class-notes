# Lecture 14: The Western Movie, contd

## Evolution of film
- aesthetic interpretation vs. reflection of the world
	- aesthetic judgment: does the film give us the sense that its understanding of the world matches the complexity we see
	- structural judgment: from a technical/formal standpoint, does it see itself as an audiovisual medium?
	- anthropological/cultural judgment: reflects the culture it embodies
- does the film show self-awareness of the assumptions it's dramatizing?
	- moves beyond a cultural artifact to an artistic object

## The Western Film
- one measure of centrality of a particular genre: whether it migrates across platforms
	- if you can find it in radio, comics, novels, film, etc, it's a solid genre
	- crime/detective stories, westerns
	- science fiction now
- ways the society combines genres is a reflection upon the cultural values of society

### Brief History
- history: silent (1903-1925) &rarr; early sound (1929-1930s) &rarr; classical age (1939-1948) &rarr; Adult Western (1950-1969)
- silent
	- _Great Train Robbery_
	- early DW Griffith's film
- early sound
	- exploitation of sound
	- Gene Autry; Roy Rogers
	- Lash LaRue Saturday matinees
- classical age
	- _Red River_ gives you hints of the psychological thriller that will develop later
	- _Buffalo Bill_ subverts traditional western ideas: Buffalo Bill is a drunken loser, Sitting Bull is this tragic and dignified character
- the "adult" western
	- _High Noon_
	- _Magnificent Seven_
		- a mark of how complicated the westerns have gotten by this point
		- remake of Kurosawa's _Seven Samurai_, which was itself influenced by westerns
- the anti-western (1970-1976)
	- _Soldier Blue_ portrays the Indians as noble and the soldiers as evil
	- _Little Big Man_ (Arthur Penn, Dustin Hoffman) has the Indians calling themselves "human beings"
- vestiges and reincarnations (1985-present)
	- David Milch's _Deadwood_ on TV
		- arguably the greatest western of all time
		- completely inverts all of the values of the western
		- who would go out there but the criminals?

## John Ford (1895-1973)
- watched a clip from _My Darling Clementine_
- shots that emphasized their relative smallness against the big sky and the looming landscape
- maybe the space could shrug off civilization
- father owned a saloon
	- most of his heroes loved the bottle
- went to Hollywood in the 1920s, started working bit parts
	- played a KKK member in _Birth of a Nation_
- directed first film in 1917, but most have been lost
- 60 sound features of which 14 are westerns
	- 3 or 4 of these are the greatest westerns ever made
- became more self-aware as he made his films
	 - got some reviews about his treatment of Indians and women
	 - ended up portraying them very delicately

## The Searchers (1956)
- based on a true story of a kidnapped girl
	- in real life, she chose to remain with her Comanche husband
	- ten year search, with an ambiguous passage of time in the film
- damaged hero
	- John Wayne character in this film is a much more complex character than ever before
	- playing against his traditional heroic figure
	- fought on the confederate side, deeply alienated, served as a bandit/marauder for a while
	- cool gauntness about his look and behavior
	- gratuitously cruel
- setting: Mountain Valley
	- establishes the contrast between the smallness of human ambition and the grandeur of this frontier
- plot: founding story, captive's tale
	- captive's tale, mixed with racial fear and fantasy
- ambiguity
	- fear of miscegenation
	- slight possibility that John Wayne will kill his niece for this
- structure: seven "threshold shots"
	- shot through doorway, out of darkness into light
	- vast expansiveness and danger of outside vs. constriction and safety of inside
	- chapter markers through this film
	- opening shot
	- 1:20
- a moral turning point
	- mistreat the Indian squab in ridiculous ways: misogyny and mistreatment of women
	- gender roles in the film are very embarrassing to modern audiences; film not necessarily aware of this
	- ride down a snowy embankment into a village where Indian women and children have been massacred by the cavalry
	- line: "why did they have to kill Luc?"
	- subjective camera from the eyes of a silent Native American chief
- the title: ambiguity
	- what are they searching for?
		- purity of the white race
		- niece who would want to unambiguously want to return to white civilization
		- no resolution
	- double for the hero: Scar, the niece's husband
	- language: Pidgin English vs. "you speak good Comanche"
	- John Ford's most complex film; John Wayne's most complex performance
