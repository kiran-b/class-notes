<h1>Recitation 1: Introduction</h1>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
Gunning, "An Aesthetic of Astonishment"
Cook, History of Narrative Film, p1-41, 51-85

<h2>Brief History of Film</h2>
- started as a magic show or sideshow attraction
- no such thing as a silent film: always accompanied by music
- Edison saw the movie as a personal experience
	- thus the kinetescope
	- going back to these days: laptops, TVs, iPhones
- stationary camera, like theater
- very staged, exaggerated expressions
- no plot, fascination with motion

<h2>The Great Train Robbery (1902)</h2>
- more sophisticated film
- still have exaggerated theater-like deaths
	- continues until 1917
- panning, but no zoom or tracking
- no character development
- character facing the camera, acknowledging an audience
- different scenes, with cuts
	- used cuts to switch out a dead body
- very mobile camera
	- in-place sets: the exterior of the train, real horses in the woods
- early special effects
- definite plot, much longer
- why was the explosion yellow? color in the dancing scene, too!
	- individually hand colored
	- kind of like 3D now
	- movie industry employed a lot of women
- music to indicate mood
	- not what the original audience heard
	- no way to regulate what each theater heard, and often improvised
- projectionists had a lot of control over the editing of the film

<h2>DW Griffiths, A Beast At Bay (1912)</h2>
- 3 years before Birth of a Nation
- Griffiths is making about a film a week at this point
- gestures are more modulated, subtle acting
- use of title cards
- lots more character development
- more smooth transitions (continuity editing)
- parallel action/crosscutting
	- juxtaposing shots from two or more sequences, actions, or stories to create the illusion that they are occurring simultaneously
	- only develops now, since it was assumed that it would confuse the audience
- point of view shots, trains coming at you
- faster cutting between scenes when the stakes got higher
