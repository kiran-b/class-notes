<h1>Lecture 2:Keaton</h1>

<h2>The Fred Ott Principle, continued</h2>
<ul>
<li>Three phases of media evolution</li>
<li>the sociological, technological, artistic, and economic changes that allow the development from the Fred Ott film to artistic, advanced films</li>
<li>1915: Birth of a Nation</li>
	<ul>
	<li>first full-feature film</li>
	<li>deeply influenced by the best-selling novel "The Klansman"</li>
	</ul>
<li>The myth of technological determinism</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Technology doesn't necessarily reach its full potential immediately.</li>
		<li>All new technologies have latencies.</li>
		<li>(ex) There was always a collection of people going to a theater, watching film produced by a technological elite. No reason it worked out this way.</li>
		<li>The process of the discovery of the technology is important. However, the technology alone does not explain this process.</li>
		<li>Technology does not explain why a particular technology becomes an embedded social form.</li>
		<li>Principle of obsolescence built into the system, too.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Often have a cultural limitation</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The inherited prejudices, diseases, and lies of a society are carried by the technology</li>
		<li>promulgated a mythology of America</li>
	</ul>
<li>Early films show the discovery of the language of film</li>
	<ul>
	<li>can see a language/syntax for this new visual medium</li>
	</ul>
<li>Go from being a nickelodeon/strip show delivery to an embedded social form.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>mobilize most of the country into a habitual routine.</li>
		<li>affects the resources available to the medium</li>
		<li>can rely on previous film knowledge.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>establishment of a star system (famous movie stars)</li>
			<li>fundamental movie genres emerge (westerns, urban crime narrative, satire and comedy, etc)</li>
			<li>genres are useful to a mass-production-style studio system</li>
			<li>economies of scale are possible as the system begins to stabilize.
		</ul>
	</ul>
<li>A paradox: capitalism and the movies</li>
	<ul>
		<li>capitalist greed was the enabling system for this form of visual art</li>
		<li>capitalism: crassest of alliances between greed and ?
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>The Great Train Robbery (1903)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Already a refined text, even though it looks like a simple film.</li>
	<li>Discovers that the shot is the basic unit of action instead of the scene.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>theatrical style: set up camera on a tripod. actors come on and off.</li>
			<li>camera becomes mobile. starts moving.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Recognition of editing and cutting shots.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Recognition of film as a two-stage process: filming and editing.
			<li>Fast cuts back and forth between scenes: principle of parallel action in Beast at Bay</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Process shots</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Some scenes are back-projected, etc.</li>
			<li>Manipulating the image in illegitimate ways.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Lonedale Operator</h2>
<ul>
	<li>scripting</li>
	<li>pre-shot schedule</li>
	<li>out-of-order filming</li>
	<ul>
		<li>expensive to set up sets if they appear again later in the movie</li>
	</ul>
	<li>film deals with hierarchies of gender</li>
		<ul>
			<li>woman takes over her father's job of a train station as he is ill</li>
			<li>Shows an anxiety over gender roles that reflects the social gender norms.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Repeats the same 3-shot trajectory</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Has a kind of visual coherence</li>
		<li>Sets up the structural geography of the film.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Buster Keaton (1895-1966)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>These jokes could not have been possible in theater.</li>
	<li>Acrobat / Actor</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Grew up as a daring acrobat, often injured as a child and in the theater.</li>
			<li>Discovered that the audience reacted more when his face was expressionless.</li>
			<li>Called the Great Stoneface</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Technician / Director</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Moves from a single joke, to a sequence of jokes, to a narrative</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Metaphysician / Artist</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Often the only character in his films.</li>
			<li>Universe he projects has a content or meaning that exploit his intelligence in creating this universe.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
<h3>The General (1927)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A camera following the train, and Keaton in the film</li>
	<li>This sequence is a sublimely rich example of the multiplicity principle</li>
	<li>Scene when woman gets up from bathtub: we're about to see her nude!</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Film suddenly cuts away. Who did that? Whose hand was that?</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Multiplicity Principle</h3>
<ul>
	<li>At some point, you get to a place where something that starts out as a gag becomes so meaningful that it understands some meaning of life.</li>
	<li>That is, Keaton's gag films ended up becoming so complicated and sophisticated that it becomes art.</li>
	<li>When events in the film do more than one job: when they forward the story and are funny and develop the character.</li>
	<li>Soap operas are often bad at this: I want to give information to the audience, but I end up violating the consistency of the character.</li>
</ul>
<h3>"A culminating text"</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The General can be understood as a kind of culminating text.</li>
	<li>Culmination of Keaton's career</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Basic character is Keaton film's basic character.</li>
			<li>A steadfast, relentless, muddling character who does everything he can to fight against incredible odds, almost despite himself.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Culmination of silent film-making as a whole</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Keaton expected his audience to recognize his films as a parody of DW Griffith's martial pretentiousness.</li>
			<li>Also hearkens back to The Great Train Robbery.</li>
			<li>Features of The General allude to the history of silent film.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
<h3>The Keaton Universe: Contingency</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We get through life not because of anything we've done, but because of accident. We live in a contingent universe.</li>
	<li>Keaton's universe shows us a universe where human action matters: if this human did not keep on so steadfastly, he wouldn't servive. However, his actions don't matter until some accident happens to keep him going.</li>
	<li>While the universe may screw you up sometimes, it doesn't always. The universe isn't angry; it's just unaware.</li>
	<li>Shows both the importance and inadequacy of human agency.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The General's Structure</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The General starts with him going up the track, having a series of adventures. He then goes down the track, repeating a mirrored version of those adventures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Fred Ott Principle (redux)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Process of discovering the language of movies</li>
	<li>Hand in front of the camera: One Week
</ul>

<h2>Keaton, once more</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The General: his masterpiece</li>
	<li>historical realism
		<ul>
			<li>location filming was revolutionary</li>
			<li>remarkable how realistic and accurate his film was</li>
			<li>patterned scenes after Civil War photographs</li>
			<li>props, locomotives, etc are all real</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>This historical realism was meant to mock the pretentious martial attitude of movies of that era.</li>
	<li>Technical achievement of the locomotive crashing into the ravine: can only do once</li>
</ul>
