## The Tramp as Myth
- films with the tramp become international phenomena
- *The Great Dictator*
	- mark of Chaplin's greatness as an artist: even in his lesser films, the images are still part of our common consciousness
- multiplicity principle
	- add pathos to comedy
- costume
	- principle of mismatch/ambiguity
	- shabby elegance
	- coat and shirt too tight, pants too loose
- is he upwardly or downwardly mobile?

- explored the implications of the closeup
- chivalrous vs. opportunistic survivor
- mythical, almost heroic characteristic to tramps
	- embodied the social actuality of the wandering tramps in these times

## Chaplin's Elemental Forms
- paradox: world of elemental themes vs. comedic world
	- most social/political of directors
	- hunger, aggression, victimization, confinement, inequity
	- disturbing themes furthest from comedy made into enduring comedy/melodrama
- elements of his themes are so essentially disturbing and unfunny
- miracle of art: takes unpromising material and depict them in an incredible poignant way
- films are always full of a resilient optimism
