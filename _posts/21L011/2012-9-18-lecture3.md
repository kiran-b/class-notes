# Lecture 3: Comparing Keaton and Chaplin

## Three Passages
- *Cops*
- *The Gold Rush*
- *City Lights*

## Modern Times (1936)
- Context
- A Culminating Film
- The Gamin
- Sound
- Structure
- Chaplin's complexity

## Multiplicity Principle
- Scene that performs multiple functions
- anti-ex: Anarchist in Keaton's *Cops*
	- set up the idea of a bomb-throwing anarchist for a joke: Keaton wanted to light a cigarette
	- doesn't actually explore the idea of the anarchist
- when something similar happens in Chaplin films, it's way more coherent
- ex: how imaginative Charlie's chase sequences are

## Scenes from
- One Week
- Steamboat Bill, Jr.
- The Great Dictator
- Modern Times

### *One Week*
- Keaton is a much more *technically* adept director
	- way more interested in the theoretical implications of film
	- interested in film as an expressive medium
- explores the relationship with film/the audience/actors/camera in much greater depth
- breaks the 4th wall: hand in front of camera
	- breaks the illusion of reality; reminds the audience that this is a ficticious creation
	- aware at every moment of the apparatus that makes this film possible
	- another measure of his self-consciousness as a director
- (ex.) *Playhouse* camera trick in which every member is Buster Keaton
- (ex.) *Sherlock, Jr.*
	- film covers the projectionist's journey through dreamland
	- affected by movie's freedom from being rooted in a particular place

### *Steamboat Bill, Jr.*
- Keaton contends against forces larger than he is (giant storm in this film)
- Hole in the building falls right over Keaton: super dangerous
	- comical because he's oblivious to the knowledge of his narrow escape
	- safety is a combination of pure luck and his own agency
- Most terrifying nature vs. Keaton
	- laws of nature seem subverted: can't stand up straight, can't walk forward, etc.
- ends up on a theater: beaten up by his own art
	- jumps into the set: the world has reorganized itself
	- world is so destabilized that there is no safety anymore
- something implicitly surrealistic about the entire experience
	- Samuel Becket (*Waiting for Godot*) was fascinated with Keaton
- Keaton's signature style: self-conscious, contending with large forces

### *The Great Director* (1940)
- socially aware director, has a reformer's zeal
- wants the viewer to recognize the screen as a general emblem of the outer world
- Hinkler and the globe
- astonishing measure of the confidence that Chaplin had in his own art that he would make a comedy on this subject

### Modern Times
- Charlie skating near a precipice, blindfolded, unaware of the danger
- Music reflects Charlie's mood and behavior
	- uses the soundtrack to express human subjectivity
	- incredible discovery of the mismatch between the soundtrack and the material
- vision of suburban excess and happiness
	- ease with which we go from reality to a narrated fantasy is a mark of Chaplin's gifts as a director
	- has a poignant rhyming counterpart later in the film when Charlie and the Gamin get a real place
- Story by a famous Yiddish writer (Badsha savant?)
	- tells the story of a man who lived a decent, moral life, but is never known by anyone
	- when he's welcomed into heaven by the chief rabbi,
	"You've lived an exemplary life, and now you're free of all of your difficulties. You can lay claim to any reward, anything you want."
	- Bansha: "Can I have a glass of tea?"
	- super poignant: his imagination of luxury is so limited
- Charlie finds himself in capitalist plenty
	- pivot of the entire film
	- in so much contrast with Charlie's vision of suburban plenty
