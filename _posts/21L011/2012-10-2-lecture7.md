# Lecture 7: Hollywood in the Thirties

## An Industry Emerges

### The Studio Era
- also known as "The Golden Age of Hollywood"
- by the 1930s, the movie industry had fully emerged
- mass production system perfected
- remarkable amount of labor specialization
	- makeup artists, production, exhibiting movies
- 1928-1930: industry spent around $500 million gearing up for sound
- 1930-1945: 7,500 films were made
	- continued at this pace through the rest of the studio era
- a vast majority of the American population regularly (every week!)
	- 80 million movie admissions per week: 67% of population
- compare this to the stats after the invention of the television
	- by 1968, 20 million movie admissions per week: about 10% of pop
	- in 1968, only 100 films were made by the system
- American films drove out to every other country
	- so intense that France imposed a limit on the number of American films that could be shown

### Three stages of film:
- pre-production stage
	- money raised, sets built and ready, etc.
	- planning stage
- production stage
- exhibition stage

### Genres
- most movies fell into particularly well-defined genres
	- action/adventure, urban crime dramas, police stories, comedy, western
- could easily reuse tropes and ideas once they'd been introduced
- economies of scale: reuse sets, etc.
- suited habitual audiences
	- had general expectations of what movies in general would do, and what a specific movie would do
	- wanted principles of familiarity to draw audiences in
- take the same genre and tweak within the genre convention
	- different stars, etc.
- audience became more and more learned about the conventions of the genre

### Star System
- magazines devoted to the mythic and private lives of the stars
	- comparable to ancient Greek gods
	- beautiful, larger-than-life characters that were often more flawed than the general population
- Lawrence Olivier
	- classical ideal of what an actor is supposed to be like
	- incredibly mutable
- American star system
	- specific actors became associated with certain acting behaviors and personas
	- you bring in priors to the film
	- Clark Gable
		- always played a self-confident, somewhat aggressive form of the American male
	- Humphrey Bogart's tough guy
	- Henry Fonda's admirable character
- created an audience that was remarkably literate
	- brought in a lot of information about the actors, genres, studios, etc.
	- movies could use these assumptions to surprise the audience (Henry Fonda's villian in *Once Upon a Time in the West*)

## The Cultural Work of Movies
### Entertainment
- idea that an earlier society's trash/entertainment could become today's art form
- word comes from "entre-act"
	- scene changes occurred with some banter between

### Genre and License
- operating within reassuring boundaries give the producer license to explore new or disturbing materials
- 1950s and 60s:
	- explored social problems within the boundary of genres
	- ex: number of western films exploring youth unrest and disobedience
	- Hollywood films generally end on a reassuring note
- disturbing dangerous contemporary themes can be explored in the sandboxed environment of genres

### Consensus Narrative
- most cultures have some form of narrative that serves as the primary storytelling form, conveying social values, culture, and ideas
- films contain a picture of how a society imagines gender relations, social institutions, governmental agencies, etc.
- the central narrative form of a society will express the most widely-held views of society
- given that film was the form of consensus stage, the Broadway stage was able to express more subversive and extreme ideas
	- there was nudity on the Broadway stage far before film
	- the theater audience was much smaller, more elite
- three characteristics
	- conservative
		- morally, technically, etc
	- accessible
		- appeals to the widest audience
	- collaborative
		- the audience is brought in to create values and ideas

## Strains of Comedy
- a measure of how widespread and nuanced the entertainment system has become
- hybrid forms: measure of sophisticated art
### Anarchic
- Marx brothers, WC fields
### Worldly
- European comedy
- European attitude towards marriage and sex
- very rich and one of the glories of Hollywood in this era
- Ernst Lubitsch in the 1930s and 40s
	- "Lubitsch touch"
	- *The Shop Around the Corner* with Jimmy Stewart, remade as *You've Got Mail*
### Screwball
- signature inventions of Hollywood
- irreverent humor
- use of very rapid vernacular dialogue
- tremendous fast pace
- some elements of slapstick comedy
- eccentric irresponsible highborn characters
- foregrounded women
- reflected the uncertainty of the 30s
	- moral values in question, etc
	- strong women and quarreling manipulative men
- witty and intelligent characters
- wonderful romances of partnership
