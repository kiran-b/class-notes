# Lecture 13: The Western Movie

## Movies as Consensus Narrative
- other form of truly American film
- in the 1950s, half of all films were westerns
- does not necessarily imply actual consensus
	- not arguing for artistic merit of consensus
	- could also have sub-cultural forms: hip-hop, opera (vs. Elizabethan theater)
- gives voice to 3 different kinds of perspective:
	- dominant/consensus values of society
	- emergent values: values and attitudes that challenge the cultural consensus
	- residual values: no longer at the center of the culture
- The Western genre as a space of discourse
	- still maintain lots of markers of western tropes
	- schoolteacher, fights with the savages, etc.
	- the gunfight! repeated in so many movies.

## Historical/Cultural Background

### Cultural background
- western movie went through phases of attitude
	- over time, the meaning and content of westerns changed in a radical way
	- John Ford's transforming film: Stagecoach
	- a measure in which central attitudes and questions changed over time
- silent films:
	- complicated films
	- not that common, though
- sound era
	- exploited sound and other astonishments
	- less complicated than silent films, in fact
- 1940s: period of the imperial western
	- post-war expansionist, racist attitudes
	- Native Americans seen as hostile, monstrous savages
	- attitudes of imperialism
- 1950s: start to get younger and more psychological
	- younger heroes seen as stand-ins for juvenile delinquents
	- generation gap considered a huge problem in this era
- 1960s: obsession with race
	- _Hombre_, starring Paul Newman, where he plays a half-breed
- 1970s: anti-westerns
	- opposite of western ideals
	- portrayed a completely different wild west
- reflected assumptions and values of the society

### Western History
- the "real" west: 1860-1890
	- all western films set in this era
	- west begins to be settled
	- first by cattle ranchers
	- saga of the transcontinental railroad (subject of many westerns)
	- CA and Dakota gold rush
- movies are born while the wild west is still a living memory
- the very first narrative film (_The Great Train Robbery_) is a western film
	- tells the real story of what is thought to be a true train robbery
	- that particular train robbery is dramatized again and again
	- Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid

#### popular culture before film
- dime novels (now comic books) told dramatic stories of the west
- stage melodramas drawn from Europe, then Americanized
- Wild West Shows
	- Buffalo Bill
	- cowboy --> entertainer
	- first started with stage melodrama "Scout of the Plains": 1972-74
	- first wild west show in 1882
	- outdoor show, with 2 international tours
	- nobility and heroism of Western expansion, rather than as invaders or usurpers
	- embodied (in a crude form) the imperial ideology of America
- ideas and stylistic forms of wild west shows are imported directly into films
	- _The Iron Horse_: covers difficulty of laying track in western territories
	- imperialism is imported directly into Western films
	- dramatic gun shows, etc.
- novels: _The Virginian_ (Owen Wister)
	- mark of Western methodology: same stories (literally) are told and retold
	- basic assumptions of the Western are established in this novel
	- nostalgic for a lost time that is imagined to be more heroic than now
	- tremendously successful novel that spawned a number of imitators

### The Turner Thesis
- "The Significance of the Frontier in American History"
- Thesis
	- the advance of expansion westward was an argument for American exceptionalism
	- the origin of the distinctive egalitarian, democratic, aggressive, and innovative features of the American character has been the American frontier experience
- 1893: Frederick Turner paper published by the American Historical Society
- Huckleberry Finn: "I can't stand civilization no more. I'm lighting out for the territory!"
- also kind of an elegy for the frontier
	- we've reached the Pacific Ocean! we're done
	- this culture cannot exist anymore
- deepest error: imperialist tendencies
	- not exactly an expansion into empty territory...
	- invasion into territory already occupied by the Native Americans

## The Western as Cultural Myth
- collective story created by all of society
- founding story
	- creation of a community in the middle of hostility
	- heroic founding story, like the Ilead or Odyssey
- dichotomies
	- civilization vs. savagery
	- east v. west
	- individualism v. collectivism
	- culture v. nature
- the divided hero: savior and savage
	- Lone Ranger and Tonto
- regeneration through violence
