# Lecture 18: _Grand Illusion_ (1937)

## Background
- made about WWI on the eve of WWII
- profound relevance for Europe
- banned in Germany and Italy, but embraced by FDR: "anyone who believes in democracy should watch this film"

## Camera
- invisible witness: respectful, attentive, restless

## Actors
- influenced Robert Altman, too
- had very clear ideas about his subject matter, but left his scripts open to improvisation and collaboration with his actors
- reason why his films are a quiet maelstrom
- very subtle use of actors in addition to the subtlest camera in film
### Von Stroheim: the man you love to hate
- German commandant
- famous director and actor
- played villainous, straight-forward roles normally
- Morally complex character in this film, elicits sympathy from audience
- plays against typecasting
- really changed the direction of the film when he signed on: a testament to the improvisatory nature of Renoir's working style
### Gabin: mad proletarian
- "you're out of your element, Donny!"
- gruff, working class man with the hints of antisemitism and rough edges of his class
- ended up gentler than his usual character
	- he usually plays proletarian rage

## Themes
### prison camp as a microcosm
- area in which ethnic and class divisions are dramatized
- also explore divisions of language and culture
- Pindo scholar is worrying about editing a version of this poetry
	- "everyone would die of the disease of his class if the war didn't reconcile all microbes"
- dramatize forms of human solidarity and community
	- reveal the democratic sharing possibilities

### barriers, boundaries
- ethnicity, nationality, language, class
- show both how porous and how insurmountable these boundaries are
- scene in which they try to dig a tunnel, but ends with "sorry, old chap, I don't understand you"
- one of the final scenes pits Dalieu (Jewish character) and Gabin (working class Frenchman) against each other
	- both men escape together, and are running across a white field together
	- camera pulls back and you see them running across this wide expanse
	- German character pulls up his rifle, and aims, but doesn't shoot
	- "why not?" -> "oh, they crossed the border"
	- what an arbitrary barrier!

### historical transition
- complex ways in which characters' class issues move forward
- someone washes Gabin's feet
	- echoes Mary Magdalene washing Jesus' feet
	- the washer was a city planner. Gabin: "what's a city planner?" -> belongs to such different worlds

## Renoir's Maturity
- character
	- every character has their flaw: Rosenthal is vain and physically weak, Gabin is aggressive but astonishingly decent
	- Rosenthal and Gabin character have a conversation about physical intimacy: "I don't even hug my wife"
	- see the characters mature and grow through the film
	- not a free agent: shaped by your entire environment
- plot: a war story without battles
- the title: how many grand illusions?
	- sheltered by a German farm woman.
		- Rosenthal speaks Yiddish to the farmwoman, Gabin begins an affair, both bond with the young daughter
		- seems entirely plausible within the film
	- aisle in winter in which the Germans and French form a little community in the middle of the war
	- dramatizes the wonderful solidarity/community among the prisoners
		- what happens when they get back into society after the war?
	- the greatest grand illusion: movies
		- this grand complex story of solidarity in the middle of war
