<h2>What is Film?</h2>
<h3>Film as Applied Chemistry</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Light interacting with emulsions cause film to appear</li>
	<li>Distinctive form of storytelling of the 20th century</li>
	<li>Profound impact on humanity</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kind of novelty</h3>
<ul>
	<li>present in penny arcades</li>
	<li>early films show this origins</li>
</ul>
<h3>Film is a manufactured object</h3>
<ul>
	<li> one of the first commodities to become mass-produced</li>
	<li> same principles that went into the production of the automobile went into firm</li>
	<li> depends on the specialization of labor</li>
	<ul>
		<li> directors, best boys, producers, etc</li>
	</ul>
	<li> could do an entire history of film as a manufactured object</li>
	<li> economically essential to American history, culture, and development</li>
</ul>
<h3>Film is a social form</h3>
<ul>
<li>developed into an essential medium of art</li>
<li>enhance the human experience</li>
<li>less self-consciously artistic movies are often the most socially revealing</li>
<li>embeds itself into society</li>
<li>vaguely true oversimplication: "democratic art"</li>
<li>reached a wider audience than any other form of narrative that had occurred before</li>
	<ul>
		<li>mostly a visual medium</li>
		<li>doesn't require any previous ability</li>
		<li>was a growing medium during a period when the US had a huge immigrant population</li>
	</ul>
<li>often more a visual extravaganza than a deep idea</li>
	<ul>
		<li>appeals across linguistic barriers; the globalized film</li>
		<li>new development in film history currently</li>
		<li>ex: Bollywood films are starting to get good at this</li>
	</ul>
<li>quickly becomes a profoundly embedded social form</li>
	<ul>
		<li>for the period when Hollywood studios were operating at full capacity (1930-1955),</li>
		<li>e vast majority of Americans went to the movies every week</li>
		<li>routine universal experience</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Not going to cover:</h3>
<ul>
<li>film as an economic engine</li>
	<ul>
		<li>how many jobs created</li>
		<li>directors, actors, theater employees, special effects, etc</li>
		<li>could make the argument that it's the most productive economic engine developed under capitalism</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Early Silent Cinema</h2>
<h3>Early Examples</h3>
- the novelty of motion kept people riveted regardless of content
- The Kiss
	- scandalized by this, banned in many cities
- The Electrocution of an Elephant
	- first snuff film; quite grotesque
	- idea of a film capturing reality
- Fred Ott's sneeze
	- one of the earliest films ever made
- trains coming into stations, Waves on a Shore
<h3>Fred Ott Principle</h3>
- process that illustrates how film goes from novelty to social form
	- in under 30 years, we go from Fred Ott sneezing to Charlie Chaplin
- this process of development evolves from the discovery of features that are unique or new to
the media
- the sociological, technological, artistic, and economic changes that allow the development
from the Fred Ott film to artistic, advanced films
- the early films aren't particularly sophisticated; what matters is the process of evolution
in this era
- the essential conventions of firm were alien at the birth of film
- around a period of 30 years, it goes from a penny arcade entertainment to one of the most
expressive art forms available
- three phases of media evolution:
	1. Imitation
	2. Technical Advance
	3. Maturity
<h3>Phase of Imitation and Patent Warfare</h3>
- All kinds of questions up in the air
	- how long should a film be?
	- how will it be exhibited?
	- how is it produced and distributed?
- nothing inherent in the technology that causes the system that arises
- don't know the peculiarities of the medium yet
- imitation of theater
	- camera still, action in front
	- theatrical expansive acting
	- understand film through the metaphor of theater
- all of the ancestor systems that lie behind the old technology influence modern film
	- ex: The Great Train Robbery
		- early tradition of performance comes from certain theatrical styles of acting
		- works for theater because the audience is so far away; need to exaggerate
- evolves fairly quickly
	- ex: The Beast At Bay
		- goes from a sleazy, morally disturbing melodrama to more subtle acting
		- mythology of rape/violence against women are replicated
		- gestures more modulated to the movies: can't do that in theater
- non-theatrical kind of acting
	- ex: Musketeers of Pig Alley
		- first urban crime film
		- Lillian Gish, a famous film star
		- performances get so much more restrained
<h4>Patent Warfare</h4>
- establishment of big studios
- patent warfare: distribution methods, how films would be created, how to exploit audiences
<h3>Technical Advance</h3>
<ul>
<li>once basic industrial stability had been reached, film makers could explore possibilities</li>
	<ul>
	<li>camera can move closer or father</li>
	<li>camera could move</li>
	<li>faster editing</li>
	</ul>
<li>feature length films (1916, 1917)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Maturity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Content of film becomes married to the medium</li>
<li>silent film can be seen as a separate entity from sound film</li>
	<ul>
		<li>early sound film not as good as late silent film</li>
		<li>changed the nature of film, and the kinds of performers you need</li>
	</ul>
<li>the advent of television overturns the institutions of the old studio era</li>
	<ul>
		<li>movies change their character again</li>
	</ul>
<li>go from Fred Ott's Sneeze to Chaplin's Modern Times</li>
</ul>

<h3>Film Permeates American Life</h3>
<ul>
	<li>film as an "embedded social form"</li>
	<li>deeply infiltrated into the personal minds
	<li>James Agee's Pulitzer Prize winning book about film</li>
		<blockquote>At supper that night, as many times before, his father said "suppose we go to the picture show?"</blockquote>
		<blockquote>This time, Charlie was stealing a bag of eggs.</blockquote>
</ul>
