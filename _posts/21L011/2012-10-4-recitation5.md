# Recitation 5: His Girl Friday

## Opening Scene
- self-assured heroine
- fast, witty dialogue
- open with an establishing shot
	- long shot, sets up the environment
- tracking shot
	- establishes the busy newsroom
- how do we know she isn't going to end up with her fiancÃ©?
	- sign "no admittance" on the door: the newspaper world that she's comfortable in isn't for Bruce
	- not intellectual equals

### Central conflict
- personal sphere: Bruce or Walter?
- professional conflict: housewife or newspaper?
- ending is going to have some sort of romantic resolution
- economy of Hollywood cinema: all this information is conveyed in the first 9 minutes
- classic Hollywood: establish a deadline
	- train by 4 o'clock

### Continuity editing
- shot-reverse shot
	- switch over-the-shoulder shots
- 180 degree rule
	- camera doesn't switch over 180 degrees
- eyeline matches

## Lunch Scene
- establishing and tracking shot
- both spheres of Bruce and Walter collide
- Walter physically takes the seat Bruce is trying to take
- Hilde's looking for respect, not protection

### Telephones
- device of deception or miscommunication
- Walter always lies on the phone, reporters always elaborate stories

## Rules and Genres in the Studio system
- set with 360 degrees
- churning out movies so quickly that maintaining a visual language/consistency helps make them quickly
- all the firms of this era have a certain look/feel to them

## Interview scene + Molly
- balance of comedy and gravity
- start losing the banter in favor of gravity

### Molly
- Molly represents a feminine counterpoint to the strong Hilde
- Molly is full of emotion, while Hilde is more reserved/cold/manipulative
- callousness is a coverup, and Molly provides a conscience for the newspapermen

## Costuming
- her suit and hat fit well within the man's world of the newspaper
- her black and white suit in the first scene are the exact shades of Bruce's traditional black suit and Walter's light one

## Battle with the Coat
- jailbreak: deep focus shot, with Hilde watching in the background
- trying to convince herself that the housewife role is for her
	- puts the coat on backward, and it doesn't fit
	- "watching her teeth grow" --> ??

## Earl Williams' Escape
- Earl's hiding in the desk
- Bruce's mother accuses Walter of a kidnapping
- Hilde and Walter end up handcuffed together

## Major themes
- role of the government
- newspaper morality
- death penalty

## Quiz next week during recitation
- series of identifications
- 11-12 terms from the semester
- asked to provide 3 significant facts about 10 of those terms
- could be something like
	- consensus narrative
	- clip we saw together in lecture
	- director mentioned in reading, but didn't talk about in recitation/lecture
	- no IDs from recitation
- ex: Charlie Chaplin
	- don't want to write: director, tramp, moved from silent films to talkies
	- not significant relevant facts
	- say: slowed the movies down, introduced closeups, interesting relationship with technology (see *Modern Times*), made silent film during sound era
	- no IMDB/Wikipedia facts
