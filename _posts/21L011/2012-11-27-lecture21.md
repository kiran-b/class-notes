# Lecture 21: Truffaut and the _Nouvelle Vague_

## Two clips
- meant to highlight the differences between these films
- _Umberto-D_ (1952)
	- old pensioner, retired Italian middle-class man
	- always well-dressed and put together
	- story of how miserably this old man is treated at the end of his life: killed by inflation
	- in this scene, on a bus with his dog.
	- tone of depression, somber social realism
	- interesting shots of the buildings from the train from below
	- most interesting thing: man comes in and sits silently next to Umberto
		- once Umberto gets up to leave, the man turns and puts his head down: he is probably in a similarly miserable state
		- retarding impulse: constantly finding distractions or moments that impede the narrative development of the film to explore moments that may have a larger connection to the world
- _The 400 Blows_ (1959)
	- about a young boy who doesn't get along very well with his parents
		- mild juvenile delinquent story
		- boy and school friend plot to steal a typewriter
	- title similar to "sow your wild oats"
		- everyone goes through a wild period
	- walk through park into a puppet show
		- jump cut away from the protagonist walking to the faces of children watching puppet
			- very abrupt cut characteristic of the _Nouvelle Vague_
		- camera's rapt attention to the children's faces has nothing to do with the main narrative thrust
	- retarding impulse: don't allow the plot to dominate the movie
		- story involves the world around as well
		- can't proceed in a strict linear fashion
	- focus in joy and delight of childhood, but the protagonists aren't as enthralled
		- sense that these children are separate from the enchantment of childhood
		- dramatizes character, not plot
- Italian neorealism: constant sense that there's some social documentary hidden behind the film we are watching
- Nouvelle vague: this sense has dissipated. More poignant and subtle because there's no overt agenda.

## Origins of the _Nouvelle Vague_

### continuity from Renoir, Italian Neorealism and the _Nouvelle Vague_
- grand traditions inherited from Renoir
- aesthetic style: mise en scène, natural lighting, absense of Hollywood artifice, etc.
- deSico's Neorealist _Shoeshine_ is the first Italian film to win the Oscar for best foreign film
	- like _400 Blows_, it focuses entirely on children
	- examination of the exploitation of children by adults
	- recognized as the spiritual predecessor to _400 Blows_, but the heavy moral and sociological undertones dissipated a little more

### American studio directors
- Hitchcock and Ford


### Bazin (1918-58) and Cahiers du cinéma
	- wrote analysis of works previously considered popular entertainment unworthy of analysis, like Hitchcock
	- argues that Hitchcock's works should be analyzed separate of the studio system
- auteur theory
	- film directors are like authors of books: they are in control of all aspects of the film
	- films should be a personal expression, not a joint group expression
- Truffaut's "A Certain Tendency of French Cinema"
	- nasty, almost unfair argument about the tradition of pompous quality in French film
	- admires neorealism and Boudu and the french movement
	- claims that the postwar directors who have intervened have become pompous and ridiculous
	- claims that the books these films were adapted from were more cinematic than their film adaptations
	- attacks the smooth simple progression of plot in these films

### Alexandre Astruc (1923-)
- caméra stylo: that the camera is equivalent to the pen of the director, and every movement is an expression

## Key films of 1959
- _Hiroshima, mon amour_ (Alain Resnais)
	- shows the personalization of the French New Wave: Hiroshima is put way in the background to the lovers' story
	- set against the greatest/most disturbing moment of the bombing of Hiroshima
	- new balance in narrative that mingles together the past, present, and subjective views
	- rejects the linear plot arrangements characteristic of Hollywood/French tradition of quality
- _Breathless_ (Jean-Luc Goddard)
	- last commercially interesting film by this great director
	- great bad boy of French cinema: by far the most inventive and imaginative
	- later films are understood as significant in an avant-garde tradition, but not necessarily having a psychological or commercial claim
	- similar strategy: lovers pass in a parade that marks the end of WWII, in which Charles de Gaulle and Eisenhower participate

## _Nouvelle Vague_: style and tone
- mise en scène
	- like Renoir, use long takes
	- interested in the interactions between characters and the world around
- location sight and sound
- improvisation: sight and sound
- jump cuts and elliptical editing
	- things are compressed and elliptical
	- disorienting cuts have been picked up by many Hollywood films
- self-reflexiveness: films about film
	- scenes in which the sound boom moves in on the film
	- reminders that the film is an illusion that depends on machine to survive
	- call attention to the manipulation of the director
	- opposite of Hollywood's window of reality style
	- love making references to their friends
	- ex: scene in _400 blows_ where characters go to a movie, which is a film by Truffaut's colleage at _Cahiers_
