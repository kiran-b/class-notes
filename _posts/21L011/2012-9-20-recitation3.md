# Recitation 3

## Modern Times Background
- technically a sound film, but silent through most of itself
- audio always through technological interfaces
- depersonalization of technology and factories
- Chaplin picks up the red flag: contrast with Keaton
	- serendipitous moments help Keaton succeed, while it throws Chaplin in jail
