# Lecture 8

## Consensus Narrative
- what values are embedded in the film?
- films as cultural artifacts
	- read them to gain some understanding of the society that produced them
- consensus narrative provides you with an official conscious idea of what the society thinks of itself
- compare to subculture's texts
	- values confined to what that subculture believes
	- Shakespeare's public theater eventually occupied this space of consensus narrative
- plays --> novels --> movies --> TV
- English historian Raymond ??
	- see society as an ongoing conversation

### Traditional, dominant and emergent voices
- traditional ideas
	- voices and values of an earlier age that are still extant, but are starting to phase out
	- film is a medium by which America debated and rehearsed its character
- emergent: new ideas
	- sitcoms as a way in which ideas about family and marriage were debated
- dominant voices

## Screwball Heroine:
- Barbara Stanwyck in *Ball of Fire* (1942)
	- sexually aggressive, manipulative cunning woman
	- wide variety of roles
- Gary Cooper
	- always a laconic character
- both playing small variations of the characters they play
	- audience simultaneously enjoys the familiar and new
- Hays office of censorship in the 1930s
	- very strict rules about physical contact between men and women
	- this film bends it without ever violating it

## Capra and Hawks
- directors that thrived in a studio system
- could be seen to sacrifice artistic integrity for entertainment
- started in silent films, but transitioned gracefully into sound, then color

### Frank Capra (1897-1991)
- graduated from CalTech in MechE
- *It's a Wonderful Life*, *Mr. Smith Goes to Washington*
- sentimental populist, but with some darker strains
- dramatize a distorted mythic America where ordinary people have a distinct sweetness
- completely unbelievable moment in *It Happened One Night* where a bus breaks into happy patriotic song

### Howard Hawks (1896-1977)
- studied MechE at Cornell
- quintessential Hollywood professional
- possibly the more interesting director
- *Red River*, starring John Wayne
	- father-son relationship between two men
	- opening of a major cattle trail
- combined genres with the greatest of ease

## *It Happened One Night* (1934)
- widely acknowledged as the first fully-realized screwball comedy
	- quarreling couple that have a connection they aren't willing to admit
	- rich, spoiled characters
- put Clark Gable on the map
- first film to win all 5 big Oscars

### Background
- Columbia films was a small, cheap film
- got Clark Gable from MGM, who was trying to temporarily wash their hands of him
- Claudette Cobel (?) was in the same situation
- ended up having to end the film without his two stars
	- both actors left before he could film the final scenes
	- remarkable ending scene

### Context: The Depression
- gracefully incorporates elements of other social classes
- part of the comedy is the Clark Gable character educating the heiress in the ways of ordinary life
- may be an escapist film, but the backdrop is realistic
	- resonance and seriousness that wouldn't otherwise occur

### The American Male
- embodiment of the forthright American male
- Gable takes his shirt off, and he isn't wearing an undershirt
	- could have been responsible for the plummeting sales of undershirts in the US
- opens the film with Gable walking around drunk
	- now liquor's freely available!
	- signifies something about his red-blooded masculinity

### Romance across social class
- both comedic and serious

### "A marriage of true minds"
- begin to act out the role of a quarreling married couple
	- take an incredible amount of joy in this improvisation
- "let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediment"

## *His Girl Friday* (1940)
- a very easy-to-follow film

### Theater into film
- famous play adapted to film for the second time
- switched the gender of the lead in another play; converted from newspaper saga to screwball comedy

### Counter-plot: against genre
- Thompson suggests that in some sense, Hawks cut across the grain of the genre of his films
- adventure stories into love stories (*His Girl Friday*), westerns into talking comedies (*Rio Bravo*), crime dramas (*The Big Sleep*)

### Central Scene: badgering companionship
- two people really saying terrible things to each other, belying a deep companionship
- simultaneous conversations at blinding speed

### Complexity: laughter and cynicism
- deep disturbing cynicism view of human nature
- actions of characters are corrupt
